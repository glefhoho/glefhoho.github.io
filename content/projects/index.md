***HERE ARE A FEW FUTURE PROJECTS I WILL BE WORKING ON:***


1. Precision Animal Health Monitoring  
*Goal:* Develop scalable, field-deployable tools to monitor zoonotic pathogens in poultry environments.  
*Approach:* Duplex qPCR, shotgun metagenomics, machine learning algorithms.   
*Why it matters:* Early detection of zoonotic pathogens and AMR markers can help reduce foodborne outbreaks and improve animal welfare.

2. AMR Surveillance in Agricultural Systems  
*Focus:* Investigating how environment factors and farm practices shape the resistome in poultry production.  
*Tools:* 16S, shotgun metagenomics, and ONT sequencing, plasmidome profiling, phenotypic resistance screening, etc.  

3. Computational Microbiology:
*Overview:* Bioinformatics tool development for differential abundance analysis in compositional microbiome data.  
*Status:* Manuscript in preparation; tool designed for reproducibility and high performance on large datasets.
